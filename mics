1. Routed ports are typically used between switches and routers 
2. Switched Virual Interfaces , Switch Port interfaces are typically used in campus environment where you need to tag multiple
   VLANs across an interface.

4. To enable Inter-VLAN Routing or Layer 3 Functionality we need to have the "ip routing" command enabled on switch.
