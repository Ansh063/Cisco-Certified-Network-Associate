Cisco Certified Network Associate - Notes : 

-> IP is 32 bit Binary Number.
-> 1 Byte = 8 Binary Bits.
-> Router always check for network Section of IP address for routing packets.

Address Classes : 
Class A, Class B, Class C = Unicast Traffic 
Class D = Multicast 
Class E = Reserved for future or Experimental Purpose	


## IPv4 Private Ip range : 
--------------------------

RFC1918 name	IP address range	        Largest CIDR block          Host ID size  Mask bits        Class

24-bit block	10.0.0.0 – 10.255.255.255	10.0.0.0/8 (255.0.0.0)	      24 bits	   8 bits	single class A network
20-bit block	172.16.0.0 – 172.31.255.255     172.16.0.0/12 (255.240.0.0)   20 bits      12 bits	16 contiguous class B networks
16-bit block	192.168.0.0 – 192.168.255.255	192.168.0.0/16 (255.255.0.0)  16 bits	   16 bits	256 contiguous class C networks

## IPv6 Private Ip : 
--------------------

In IPv6 there is a special "Unique Unicast" IP range of fc00::/7
